        Kevin Darnell Hart (born July 6, 1979) is an American stand-up comedian
        and actor. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hart began his
        career by winning several amateur comedy competitions at clubs
        throughout New England, culminating in his first real break in 2001 when
        he was cast by Judd Apatow for a recurring role on the TV series
        Undeclared. The series lasted only one season, but he soon landed other
        roles in films such as Paper Soldiers (2002), Scary Movie 3 (2003), Soul
        Plane (2004), In the Mix (2005), and Little Fockers (2010). Hart's
        comedic reputation continued to grow with the release of his first
        stand-up album I'm a Grown Little Man (2008), and performances in the
        films Think Like a Man (2012), Grudge Match (2013), Ride Along (2014)
        and its sequel Ride Along 2 (2016), About Last Night (2014), Get Hard
        (2015), Central Intelligence (2016), The Secret Life of Pets (2016),
        Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (2017), Jumanji: Welcome to the
        Jungle (2017), Night School (2018), and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019).
        He also released four more comedy albums, Seriously Funny in 2010, Laugh
        at My Pain in 2011, Let Me Explain in 2013, and What Now? in 2016. In
        2015, Time Magazine named Hart one of the 100 most influential people in
        the world on the annual Time 100 list. He starred as a fictionalized
        version of himself in the lead role of Real Husbands of Hollywood. In
        2017, Hart launched the Laugh Out Loud Network, a subscription video
        streaming service in partnership with Lionsgate.
